## 1.28

* Add: `printScreen()` method to interfaceManager to dump display as
  ASCII to a stream.

## 1.26

* Fix: paged update for console debug and testing

## 1.24

* Add: paged update implementation in `InterfaceManager`

## 1.22

* Add: `FieldEditor` in disabled edit in place mode when in place edit
  is available, uses `fieldUpdater` if available to print the hint in
  place of options.

## 1.20

* Add: Progress bar drawing `gfx_progress_bar_to(...)`

## 1.18

* Add: Progress bar drawing `gfx_progress_bar_to(...)`

* Fix: reduced character rendering by more than x2 by implementing bit
  blit function to copy character data in bytes where possible. Faster
  char processing if starting on byte boundary for y coordinate
  (0,8,16,24) when one column can be copied in one operation.

  This also sped up display of characters with background color not set
  to NONE. Previously it doubled the rendering time. Now takes about 60%
  more.

## 1.16

* rename `ssd1306_` prefix to `gfx_` prefix

* remove `gfx_flush_wrap_chars()` and replace with
  `gfx_start_text_spc_wrap()` and `gfx_end_text_spc_wrap()` to delimit
  output that is wrapped. All else is may be wrapped only by right
  margin.

## 1.14

* Fix: reduced display update by x2, TWI interrupt based update takes 16
  uSec vs 13.5 ms for blocking.

* Fix: reduced char output for display update by optimizing and removing
  unnecessary use of black background when printing screen data, already
  on a black background.

* Add: contrast config option to modify display brightness/contrast.

* Add: `fieldChanged()` callback to `FieldUpdater` to `FieldEditor`
  ability to update external values on value change in the popup (i.e.
  contrast).

## 1.13

* Fix: optimizations, use interrupt driven TWI interface from
  [ATmega328p](https://github.com/goessl/ATmega328P) library.

## 1.12

* Fix: gfx circle and round rect

## 1.6

* Add: small font to allow printing inside single height boxes. ie.
  battery with % charge in it. The battery is assumed to fit into one
  char height and made up of two or three characters.

* Add: proper on white space text wrapping to margins. Handles solid
  runs of non-break text by wrapping where ever to not exceed the right
  margin.

* Add: text bounds now tracks both min/max x/y coordinates where text is
  output. Including cursor moves and text size changes.


## 1.5

* Fixed code to use the more efficient gfx calls and functionality

## 1.4

* Change gfx to self rolled. Had 30668 bytes of FLASH used, now only
  23426\.

* rewrite implementation by directly controlling TWI hardware without
  the Arduino I2C library code to reduce implementation to bare minimum.
  This project only has a single slave (OLED display) and only master to
  slave communication at the maximum allowable speed. No need for
  transactions or switching TWI clock speed.

* rewrite SSD1306 implementation to reduce code size for this
  implementation.

## 1.0

Initial implementation


## 0.1

* Initial somewhat working graphics

## 0.2

* Fix: circle quadrants to not overlap when drawing dashed or inverted
  outline.

* Add: octant flags to rect() to draw selected quadrants (top, right,
  bottom, right) and roundRect() to draw selected octants (top,
  top-right corner, right, bottom-right corner, bottom, bottom-left
  corner, left, top-left corner).
